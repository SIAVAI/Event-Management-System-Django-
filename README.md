## üöÄ Features

* **Event CRUD:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete events with detailed information including name, description, date, time, location, and category.

* **Responsive Design:** Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, mobile-first, and responsive user interface.
* **Database Efficiency:** Utilizes `select_related` and `prefetch_related` for optimized database queries (reducing N+1 problems) and `annotate` for efficient participant counts.
